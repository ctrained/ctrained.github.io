                    <p>Being performers, we live and thrive in a world where what we put forth is at the mercy of how it’s perceived by an audience.  Your wig, your stage makeup, your costume, the lighting, it all creates an illusion that is tailored for the public.  <a id="more"></a>Nothing in the realm of a staged presentation is actually intimate in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>I sang a very important audition last week, for a one man audience, in a choral rehearsal space, in the standard manner.  I dressed my best (but not in a black dress because well, that’s boring) choosing instead a bright white and gray outfit with silver accessories.  Now, I have been singing consistently in fully staged productions for several years, and have sung fewer and fewer auditions; zero, in fact, in the past 2 years.  While to the outside ear this seems to be an indication of success, as the time came closer to my big day, I was getting more and more fearful.  What if I forgot the words to my big arias?  What if the parts that were easy before had become inaccessible now?  I had my old list of 5 or 6 go-tos, all varying in language and style.  But these were incredibly difficult pieces that I couldn’t just roll out of bed and sing on any given day.  So I of course spent a lot of time practicing and preparing, getting these pieces back into my voice.  And yes, your voice today is not the voice you had last year.  So I made some adjustments, and assessed where my voice felt in the present.</p>
<p>The present.  Now, there’s an idea.  Yes, some things felt weird, but others felt incredibly free...I have no idea what exactly I’d been doing differently other than growing and shifting as any human does, and all I could think as audition day approached was, “well, sing with what you have.  Pretend you’re on stage and you’re the star of the show.”  </p>
<p>I arrived a half hour early and tried to get myself to just breathe.  I hadn’t felt that nervous in a long time.  The presenter showed up ten minutes early and wanted me to begin immediately, but my manager had not yet arrived.  I was already nervous when he asked me why I needed to wait for my manager; he wasn’t going to sing!  Eventually everyone showed up but I was a bundle of insecurity before it was my turn on the stage.  </p>
<p>As the door closed behind me, I presented my best professional manner, which to me means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smile and greet the person with confidence</li>
<li>Take the stage as yourself; you don’t need to impress anybody but you know you are fabulous</li>
<li>Announce what piece you will sing concisely; wait for the pianist to get himself situated</li>
<li>Gracefully present your face in character before the start of the intro</li>
</ol>
<p>Then it all boiled down to one final thing.  The best presentation of my best intentions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We judge others by their actions; we judge ourselves by our intentions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the weeks leading up to this 10 minute window of time, I’d gone through every possible scenario in my head.  At night I pictured myself forgetting words, missing entrances, skipping phrases by accident, getting lost.  I realized that these nightmares were not going to help me and certainly weren’t going to win the day.  If you give these presentiments (fears) power, they grow pretty incessantly and take over your life!  Stage fright manifests itself way before you ever hit the stage and open your mouth.  </p>
<p>As I felt these negative thoughts creeping in, I actively combated them with positive thoughts AND actions.  After all, the idea that you’ll do well is not enough.  Just like the visualization of success, while powerful, is not sufficient to guarantee a winning situation.  It must be combined with the practice of getting there, the literal, grinding work.  And because others judge you by your actions (that 10 minute slot you have to impress a casting director) that is all you have left to rely on.  Therefore, allow your intentions to motivate your actions.  You want to sing your absolute best?  You know what has to be lined up in order for that to happen.  You want to look great?  You know how long it takes you to get ready and make sure everything is in place.  You want to be on time?  You know what time to leave your house.</p>
<p>Letting your intentions (that is, the desire to succeed) guide your actions in all the time leading up to a presentation is incredibly important, and it doesn’t stop once you are on that stage.  That is the time when intentions morph into musical manifestations.  Every inhale is an intention to sing a phrase.  Every crescendo is a building block to a special moment, or a dramatic beat.  Every note has a purpose, a reason for being there.  Before you begin to sing, know what your character has just experienced, and what they want to express, and WHY they must express it.  If there is an idea behind every word you sing, it will show very clearly to an audience of one person, or 1,000 people.  </p>
<p>The same goes for how you hold your body when you sing.  People ask a lot, “is it okay to move during an audition?  Should I just stand still?  Do I grab the piano?”  The answers to these questions lie in your own mind.  How do YOU feel when you watch someone else sing a recital or a solo concert or even a solo scene on stage, and they grab the piano?  How do you react to their connection to their own body?  Do you tense up?  Do you feel nervous or afraid for them?  Chances are, you are reflecting what they are putting out, and it’s your job as a singer then, to make sure what you put out to an audience is what you intend.  </p>
<p>As I sang my arias, I felt myself naturally wanting to do specific things, and I just went with it.  Why fight it?  These are characters I’ve played on stage, and I felt confident that if I moved with purpose or even stood still with purpose, it would read equally as well in this small room.  What I kept telling myself was “Commit.  If you’re going to move your arm, move your arm, finish the action, fulfill the intention, and then put your arm down.”  That is something I learned from a wonderful director, Stephen Wadsworth at the Met.  Acting (and singing) is about making a commitment, a decision to go with something 100% and seeing it through.  That shows confidence.  It’s a musical phrase, it’s a dramatic phrase.  </p>
<p>When I finished, I realized that I had sung one of the best auditions of my life, because I focused on my intentions both musically and dramatically, and they put me at ease and made me sing better.  For the first time in any of my auditions, I finally felt like a professional.  </p>
